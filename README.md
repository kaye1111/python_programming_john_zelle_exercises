# python_programming_john_zelle_exercises
These are my solutions to the programming exercises at the end of each chapter of the book "Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science" by John Zelle, Third Edition.

I'm a beginner, and at this point this is my first time working with python, so there may be errors. I will update as I continue through the book.
If there is any advice on how to make any of these programs better, constructive critism is appreciated.
